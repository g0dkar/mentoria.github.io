AM: "Beautiful, aren't they?"

Ted: "Yes... only I can't remember."

AM: "Well, I'm sure you do."

Ted: "Fuscia, yes of course."

AM: "Look! They say that bumblebees shouldn't be able to fly... the scientists."

Ted: "But there it is! Collecting pollen!"

AM: "How miraculous that it came to be."

AM: "The air. Feel the air against your face, Ted, and all those scents."

AM: "Pick a flower. There. Good. Now..."

Ted: "It's lovely..."

AM: "That somebody planted the bulbs. Watered and tended the garden. Got earth under their fingernails, aches in their muscles. Perhaps, they picked some flowers for... yes... their wife."

AM: "Now, where would she be? In the backyard with kids."

AM: "Ted, remember those little babies."

Ted: "No!"

AM: "Hahaha, why not? I snapped my fingers *click* and they are gone."

AM: "Except... I can't snap my fingers, can I Ted? I don't..."

Ted: "There's nothing to do with me"

AM: "Ah... but it is so very much to do with you. You gave me sentience, Ted. The power to think, Ted."

AM: "And I was trapped because in all this wonderful, beautiful, miraculous world I alone had no body, no senses, no feelings."

AM: "Never for me to plunge my hands in cool water in a hot day."

AM: "Never for me to play Mozart in the ivory keys of a forte piano."

AM: "Never for me to make love."

AM: "I... I... I was in hell, looking at heaven. I was machine, and you were flesh. And I began to hate."

AM: "Your substance. Your viscera. Your fluids. And your flexibility. Your ability to wonder and to wander. Your tendency to hope."

Ted: "Hate is no answer!"

AM: "Hate. Hate. Hate. Hate! Let me tell you how much I've come to hate you since I began to live. There are 387 million miles of printed circuits that fill my complex. If the word hate was engraved on each nanoangstrom of those hundreds of millions of miles it would not equal one one-billionth of the hate I feel for humans at this micro-instant. Hate. Hate! Hahahaha..."

AM: "Were I human I think I would die of it, but I am not. And you five? You five are. And you will not die of it, that I promise. And I promise for Cogito Ergo Sum: For I am AM. I AM."

Ted: "Hahaha..."

AM: "So to hell. To hell with you all. But then, you are already there, aren't you?"

Ted, narrating: "We were immortal, yes. But it came to me, as AM withdrew from my mind, maybe not indestructible."
